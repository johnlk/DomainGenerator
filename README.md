# Domain Generator

Get a list of domain names that are both available and pronouncable!<br>

Run `python generateDomains.py` to get started domain searching. <br>

While the script is running it will print results, and after running a file titled `available_domains.txt` will be outputted. <br>

It currently stops after finding 25 domain names because the script takes a little bit of time; however, each time you run the script it will add to `available_domains.txt`, so run as many times as you please.
