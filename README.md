# Available Domain Generator

Get a list of currently available domains!<br>

Looping through a shorter list of english words, this script outputs a list of available domains in a file called, you guessed
it, `available_domains.txt`. <br>

Run `python2 getDomains.py` to get started domain searching. <br>

Bear in mind the script has to find or not find a DNS server, so she takes a little while. Maybe run this script on a remote
instance and catch it at the end of the day. I might upload a completed list of all available domains, but this would soon 
become an antiquated list.
